 * This class is responsible for managing input from the user (keys).
 * This class should call a method startRecord() when the record button is first pressed,
 * and than call stopRecord() when the record button is pressed again. Just put comments in where these
 * would go for now.
 * <p>
 * We also need to consider how to display a recording notification on the screen, an "upload finished" notification
 * and consider displaying error messages.
 * <p>
 * A config file might be useful.
